 
The Workflow Event Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 When a Imixs BPMN Event Element is selected in the Drawing Canvas, different settings can be
 configured from the tabbed property sheets displayed in the Property View.
 
[images/bpmn_screen_05.png]

 The property settings are grouped into different sections.
 
*General Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The property tab 'General' defines basic informations for an Imixs BPMN Event element. 

[images/bpmn_screen_19.png]


**Name 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The name of the Event element is used to identify the processing action.
 The name typical describes the activity triggered by the user to process a WorkItem.
 e.g. "submit", "approve" "close".

**Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The description of the Event element is used by the Imixs Workflow System to provide the user
 with additional information about the event. Typically a description can provide information
 how the event will change the current status of the process instance.
 
 
 
*Workflow Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The Tab 'Workflow' contains Processing Information of a Event element. These information
 are evaluated by the Worklfow Engine while a WorkItem is processed .

**ID 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Every Workflow Event assigned to a Workflow Task has an unambiguously ID. The Event ID is used 
 by the Workfow Engine to identify the Event triggered by the user.
 
 
**Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The 'Result' defines application specific processing information evaluated by the Workflow Engine.
 These information can be used to display a message or a confirmation page to the user after a the
 event was triggered. The 'Result' can also be used to provide additional processing information to
 the workflow engine or a application specific plug-in.    

 
**Visiblity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 The property 'visible' defines if a Imixs BPMN Event is an active trigger displayed as an action 
 command inside the application. Non-Visible Events are used to control the workflow programmatically. 
 
 
**Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Each Workflow Event can define a set of read permissions. This is used to control the access 
 to an Event depending on the user permissions. If no roles are assigned to a Event the Event can 
 be triggered by any workflow user.
 
  
*ACL Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The ACL Tab defines the Access Control List for a workitem processed by the Imixs-Workflow engine.

[images/bpmn_screen_21.png]  

 The ACL defines the read- and write access a user will be granted for, after a WorkItem was successful 
 processed. This is one of the most important features of the Imixs Workflow System.
 The ACL can be defined in a dynamic or a static way. To activate the feature the option 
 'Update ACL' has to be checked.

**Owner, Read and Write Access

 The ACL of a WorkItem is defined in three different layers. 
 
 The 'Owner' defines the users assigned to the WorkItem for the next Workflow Task. This setting typically 
 adds the WorkItem to the users task list. 
 
 The 'Read Access' is used to restrict the read access for a WorkItem. Only users which are assigned 
 to the Read Access of a WorkItem can access the workitem from the application. If no Users or Roles are
 defined in the Read Access not read restrictions are set to a WorkItem.
 
 The 'Write Access' restricts the author access for a WorkItem. The Author Access depends on the 
 AccessLevel a user is granted for. If a user is assigned to the role 'org.imixs.ACCESSLEVEL.AUTHORACCESS'
 and is not listed in the Write Access List of a WorkItem, the user is not allowed to change or process 
 the WorkItem. 
 
 See the section {{{http://www.imixs.org/jee/acl.html}security settings}} for more details.    

**Dynamic ACL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The dynamic ACL settings are used to compute the access list based on the definition of 'Actors'. 
 Actors play an essential role in a user-centric workflow system. The actors are computed dynamically 
 based on the properties of a WorkItem. See the section {{{./main_editor.html}Process Property Editor}} for more 
 information how to define Actors in an Imixs BPMN model. 

**Static ACL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 It is also possible to define the ACL in a static way. The UserIDs and Role names have to match the 
 login name and role definitions of the workflow application. The following Imixs standard roles 
 can be used here:


 * org.imixs.ACCESSLEVEL.READACCESS
 
 * org.imixs.ACCESSLEVEL.AUTHORACCESS
 
 * org.imixs.ACCESSLEVEL.EDITORACCESS
 
 * org.imixs.ACCESSLEVEL.MANAGERACCESS


*History Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This property defines the history information added to a WorkItem during a process step. 

[images/bpmn_screen_22.png]  

 For each Event processed by the Imixs-Workflow engine a new History entry will be added into the WorkItem.
 The history results in a user-friendly process documentation like in the following example:

+-------------+



*Mail Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The property section 'Mail' defines information for mail messaging during a process step.

[images/bpmn_screen_23.png]  

 A mail message is defined by the mail subject and mail body. Both fields support the {{{./textreplacement.html}Text Replacer feature}}.
 
 A mail message can define different recipients in the sections 'To', 'CC' and 'BCC'. 
 See the section {{{./main_editor.html}Process Property Editor}} for more 
 information how to define Actors in an Imixs BPMN model.
