Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The Imixs-BPMN Modeler is a graphical tool for authoring workflow models that are
 compliant with the OMG BPMN 2.0 standard.  It is assumed that the reader is familiar with BPMN 2.0 and
 its applications. There a several online tutorials about the details of the BPMN 2.0 and the 
 specification.
 
 Imixs-BPMN is based on the  {{{https://www.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/}Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler}} and the Eclipse BPMN2 Metamodel, which was developed
 by contributing members of the OMG BPMN 2.0 working group and is fully compliant
 with the spec. The Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler UI surfaces the most commonly used BPMN elements. 
 Imixs-BPMN extends the BPMN2 metamodel in the manner prescribed by the specification.
 
   
 
 
*General concepts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 As shown in the screenshot below, Imixs-BPMN provides all of the BPBMN features in a Tool Palette at 
 the right side of the editor panel. The Drawing Canvas in the main area of the editor window is
 used to place the BPMN elements into the model.

 BPMN elements can be placed on the canvas by selecting them from the Tool Palette and
 clicking anywhere on the canvas. Elements can be moved on the canvas and
 connected (with, e.g. Sequence Flows, Associations, Data Flows, etc.) by selecting a connection tool
 from the palette and then first clicking the source element.
 
*The Imixs-BPMN Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The Tool Palette is, by default, located along the right edge of the Drawing Canvas. It consists of
 several standard BPMN2 elements that can be dragged onto the Drawing Canvas.
 
 The Imixs-BPMN plug-in provides a separate section called "Imixs-Workflow". This category contains the 
 "Imixs-Workflow Task" and the "Imixs-Workflow Event" Elements. Both elements are extensions
 to the BPMN Task and Event Elements defined by the BPMN 2.0 spec.
 The elements can be dragged like any other BPMN element onto the canvas to describe a workflow to 
 be executable inside the Imixs-Workflow engine.


** The Imixs-BPMN Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The Imixs-BPMN Task Element is a extension to the BPMN Task Element and can be used to describe a
 Imixs-Workflow Task inside a workflow. Typically the Task Element reflects the task to be processed 
 by a participant in a defined workflow status.
 The Imixs-BPMN Task Element contains a custom set of properties used 
 to describe the status of a process instance controlled by the Imixs-Workflow engine. 
 
 
** The Imixs-BPMN Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The Imixs-BPMN Event Element is a extension to the BPMN CatchEvent and can be used to describe a
 transition from one Imixs-Workflow Task into another. The Imixs-BPMN Event contains a custom set 
 of properties to be evaluated during the execution by the Imixs-Workflow engine.
